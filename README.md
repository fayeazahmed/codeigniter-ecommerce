Lot of the development stuff around this location is still being done using php and php based frameworks. So learned this classic server side language and a simple framework- codeigniter 4. This a e-commerce site. There is admin dashboard, products can be added dynamically. Orders are stored in database with user info, cart items are saved in session. So there isn't really any user model, or implementation of foreign key relation between user and orders. Will be learning and using those in next project.
